the abandoned warehouse on the edge of town has been slowly collapsing for fifteen years now ever since the manufacturing company that built it moved their operations overseas leaving behind a shell of rusted metal and broken windows that now serves as an unofficial monument to economic forces beyond anyones control weeds grow through cracks in the concrete loading dock where trucks once delivered raw materials and carried away finished products destined for stores across the midwest the security fence that once surrounded the property has gaps torn in it by vandals or maybe just by time and weather allowing urban explorers and graffiti artists to claim the interior walls as canvases for their commentary on society and politics and love and loss spelled out in spray paint colors that glow under streetlights when darkness falls over the industrial district that has become a graveyard for dreams and ambitions that once seemed so solid and permanent to the workers who spent their days inside those walls breathing air that smelled of machine oil and possibility before the global economy shifted beneath their feet like tectonic plates rearranging themselves according to laws of supply and demand that care nothing for human attachment to place or purpose yet somehow nature has begun to reclaim the space sending vines through broken windows and birds to nest in the rafters where they sing songs that no one hears except the occasional photographer or urban explorer who comes to document the slow motion transformation of industry into wilderness
