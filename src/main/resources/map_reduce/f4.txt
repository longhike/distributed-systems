vintage photographs have a way of making the past seem both more real and more distant than it actually was especially those old black and white family portraits where everyone looks stern and formal because they had to hold still for so long while the camera captured their images on glass plates or early film the faces staring back from those frames seem to carry the weight of their entire era compressed into a single frozen moment that we can now examine from our comfortable distance of decades or centuries wondering what they were thinking about as they posed in their best clothes in front of painted backdrops or beside ornate furniture that probably represented their most valuable possessions i inherited a box of such photographs from my grandmother including images of relatives whose names have been lost to time but whose eyes still seem to follow me around the room when i spread the pictures across my kitchen table trying to piece together the fragments of family history that survived the moves and divorces and deaths that scattered our collective memory to the winds some of the photographs show children playing in yards that no longer exist in front of houses that were torn down decades ago to make room for strip malls and parking lots while others capture moments of celebration or mourning that once seemed monumentally important to the people involved but now exist only as visual echoes in fading silver halide crystals
