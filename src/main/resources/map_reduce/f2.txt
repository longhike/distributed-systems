the coffee shop on fifth street has become my second home over the past three months ever since i started working remotely and discovered that my apartment walls were closing in on me like a slow moving vise the baristas know my order now which is both comforting and slightly embarrassing since it means i spend too much time here nursing the same cup of dark roast for hours while pretending to work on my laptop but really just watching people come and go through the glass doors that never seem to stop moving students rush in between classes clutching textbooks and looking perpetually exhausted business people tap their feet impatiently while waiting for complicated drinks with names that sound more like chemistry experiments than beverages elderly couples sit at corner tables sharing newspapers and comfortable silences that speak of decades spent learning each others rhythms and preferences the background music shifts from jazz to indie rock to something that might be described as atmospheric depending on who is working behind the counter today and whether they prefer their workplace soundtrack to energize or soothe the constant flow of customers seeking caffeine salvation from their daily routines sometimes i wonder what stories these strangers carry with them as they order their drinks and disappear back into their lives leaving only the lingering scent of vanilla and espresso to mark their brief presence in this small universe of ceramic mugs and recycled napkins
